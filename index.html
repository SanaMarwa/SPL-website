              Individual development given by the teachers to students which I
              found different in SPL. The in-charges see that the teachers are
              explaining their concept clearly that even the weakest student
              understands it and gets involved in the class. SPL focuses not
              only toppers but also sees that any weak student is improving
              atleast by 1 or 2 marks that motivates them for hardwork. SPL
              school motivates students by using motivation marks daily given to
              the students not for Academic but on behavior, discipline, English
              speaking and punctuality. The school has also introduced ELDC
              classes from G1 to G8 . Students read , comprehend and write what
              they have understood which has helped students in learning skills.
              I have worked as an Academic Coordinator and got a very
              professional ambiance to develop myself. It was a very great
              experience.
